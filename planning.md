# Do High Heat Index Values Relate to Preterm Birth?
A quick summary of my internship at the Southeast Regional Climate Center

## Slide 1
* I began my work with creating a literature review and summarized peer-reviewed articles that focused on similar issues
  * There have been loose associations correlating high temperatures to preterm birth in cows and humans in India, Australia, and across Europe

## Slide 2
### Variables
* Maximum, minimum, average, and dew point temperature values to calculate heat index
* Demopgraphic information about the mother
* Birth data from vital records
* Access to physician care

## Slide 3
### Data Analysis
* STATA

## Slide 4
### Results
* Loose correlation so far
* Will run more tests at the Research Hub
* Expecting a positive correlation
