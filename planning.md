# Do High Heat Index Values Relate to Preterm Birth?
I'm spending the summer working under a medical geographer and a meteorologist at the Souteast Regional Climate Center on Franklin Street

# Process
* I began my work with creating a literature review and summarized peer-reviewed articles that focused on similar issues
  * There have been loose associations correlating high temperatures to preterm birth in cows and humans in India, Australia, and across Europe
* Statistical Data Analysis  

# Variables
* Maximum, minimum, average, and dew point temperature values to calculate heat index
* Demopgraphic information about the mother
* Birth data from vital records
* Access to physician care

# Data Analysis
* STATA

# Results
* Loose correlation so far
* Will run more tests at the Research Hub
* Expecting a positive correlation

# Final Steps
* Write an article
* Hopefully be published
