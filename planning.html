#Do High Heat Index Values Relate to Preterm Birth? - Yes
A quick summary of my internship at the Southeast Regional Climate Center
</section>

<section>
* I began my work with creating a literature review and summarized peer-reviewed articles that focused on similar issues
  * There have been loose associations correlating high temperatures to preterm birth in cows and humans in India, Australia, and across Europe
</section>

<section>
### Variables
* Maximum, minimum, average, and dew point temperature values to calculate heat index
* Demopgraphic information about the mother
* Birth data from vital records
* Access to physician care
</section>

<section>
### Data Analysis
* STATA
</section>

<section>
### Results
* Loose correlation so far
* Will run more tests at the Research Hub
* Expecting a positive correlation
